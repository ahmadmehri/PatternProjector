This GitHub repository contains the software solution developed for a pattern projection system used in tunnel excavation. The software is designed to project blasting patterns directly onto tunnel faces using standard projectors, eliminating the need for manual marking and improving both precision and efficiency in underground operations.
Key Features:
- Pattern Projection: Generates and displays blasting patterns onto the tunnel face to assist in accurate drilling layout.
- Alignment Methodologies: Implements three alignment approaches—manual, automatic, and semi-automatic—with the semi-automatic method offering an optimal balance of precision and usability.
- Geological & Blast Data Visualization: Integrates drilling patterns, geological information, and blast design parameters for enhanced operational adaptability.
- Hardware-Agnostic: Functions without requiring specialized hardware, allowing easy deployment with standard projection systems.
- Operational Flexibility & Safety: Designed for underground environments, reducing manual intervention while maintaining accuracy and safety standards.
This software bridges the gap between digital design and physical execution in tunnel excavation, supporting modernized construction practices with increased efficiency and reduced positioning errors. The repository includes documentation, installation guides, and source code for users to deploy and further develop the system.
